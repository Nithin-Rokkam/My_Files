/*
        COLOUMN-MAJOR ORDER
LOC(A[I,J])=Base(A)+W * ((II-LR)*N+(J-LC))
B=Base Address
I=Row subset whose address to be found
J=Coloumn subset whose address to be found
W=Storage size
LR=Lower limit of row
LC=Lower limit of coloumn
M=Number of rows

Example:Given an array arr[1..10][1..15] with base value 100 and size of each element is 1Byte in memory.
Find the address of arr[8][6].
